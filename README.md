boost-nar
=========

The Boost C++ libraries in maven form for producing Nar artefacts.

To install simply clone the repo and run:
  mvn install


The libraries are available as separate dependencies as per a typical module layout. This means if required you can depend only upon the boost filesystem module, the necessary transitive depedencies will be automatically available.


Not tested the build on linux yet. Should be fine...
